Hey, how are you going?

I'm a year 12 this year (2023) making my way through IT assignments and learning new topics. I am recording my projects and progress through this account. My progress reports can be found at [this account's website](https://joush007.github.io), and any projects that I've done and saved can be found in my public repositories.
